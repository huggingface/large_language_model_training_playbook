# 📖 The Large Language Model Training Playbook

This playbook is a companion to the [LLM Training Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/llm_training_handbook) which contains a lot more details and scripts.

An open collection of implementation tips, tricks and resources for training large language models.

The following covers questions related to various topics which are interesting or challenging when training large language models.

## [Deciding on a model architecture](./architecture/)

## Deciding on a model parallelism strategy

## Deciding on the model size

#### Scaling laws

#### Trade-off of large language model sizes

## Issues and questions related to tensor precision

### What to chose between fp32, fp16, bf16

### Mixed-precisions for optimizers, weights, specifics modules

### How to finetune and integrate a model trained in a precision in another precision

## [Selecting training hyper-parameters and model initializations](./hparams)

### Learning rate and learning rate schedules

### Questions on batch size

## [Maximizing throughput](./throughput)

## [Avoiding, recovering from and understanding instabilities](./instabilities)

### Detecting instabilities early

### Training tips to reduce instabilities

## Issues with data and data processing

## [Debugging software and hardware failures](./debug/)

## Tips on what metrics to follow during the training

## [Resources](./resources/)
