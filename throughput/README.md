# How to Maximize Training Throughput

The faster you can make your model to train the sooner the model will finish training, which is important not only to being first to publish something, but also potentially saving a lot of money.

In general maximizing throughput is all about running many experiments and measuring the outcome and chosing the one that is superior.

In certain situations your modeling team may ask you to choose some hyper parameters that will be detrimental to throughput but overall beneficial for the overall model's success.

## Crucial reproducibility requirements

The most important requirements for a series of successful experiments is to be able to reproduce the experiment environment again and again while changing only one or a few setup variables.

Therefore when you try to figure out whether some change will improve performance or make it worse, you must figure out how to keep things stable.

For example, you need to find a way to prevent the network usage from fluctuations. When we were doing performance optimizations for [108B pre-BLOOM experiments](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/tree/master/train/tr8-104B-wide) it was close to impossible to perform, since we were on a shared internode network and the exact same setup would yield different throughput depending on how many other users used the network. It was not working. During BLOOM-176B we were given a dedicated SLURM partition with an isolated network where the only traffic was ours. Doing the performance optimization in such environment was just perfect.

## Network throughput

It's critical to understand your particular model size and framework requirements with regard to network bandwidth, throughput and latency. If you underpay for network you will end up having idle gpus and thus you wasted money and time. If you overpay for very fast network, but your gpus are slow, then again you wasted money and time.

If your network is very slow, your training is likely to be network-bound and many improvements in the training setup will not help with the improving performance.

Here is a simple all-reduce benchmark that you can use to quickly measure the throughput of your internode network:

[all_reduce_bench.py](./all_reduce_bench.py)

Usually benchmarking at least 4 nodes is recommended, but, of course, if you already have access to all the nodes you will be using during the training, benchmark using all of the nodes.

To run it on 4 nodes

```
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=4 all_reduce_bench.py
```

You may get results anywhere between 5Gbps and 1600Gbps (as of this writing). The minimal speed to prevent being network bound will depend on your particular training framework, but typically you'd want at least 400Gbps or higher. Though we trained BLOOM on 50Gbps.

Frameworks that shard weights and optim stages like [Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) w/ ZeRO Stage-3 do a lot more traffic than frameworks like [Megatron-Deepspeed](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/Megatron-DeepSpeed) which do tensor and pipeline parallelism in addition to data parallelism. The latter ones only send activations across and thus don't need as much bandwidth. But they are much more complicated to set up and run.

Of course, an efficient framework will overlap communications and compute, so that while one stage is fetching data, the other stage in parallel runs computations. So as long as the communication overhead is smaller than compute the network requirements are satisfied and don't have to be super fantastic.


## Checkpoint activations

Enabling checkpoint activations allows one to trade speed for memory. When this feature is activated instead of remembering the outputs of, say, transformer blocks until the backward pass is done, these outputs are dropped. This frees up huge amounts of GPU memory. But, of course, a backward pass is not possible without having the outputs of forward pass, and thus they have to be recalculated.

This, of course, can vary from model to model, but typically one pays with about 20-25% decrease in throughput, but since a huge amount of gpu memory is liberated, one can now increase the batch size per gpu and thus overall improve the effective throughput of the system.
